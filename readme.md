# QR Code REST API â€“ Assignment Completion

I fixed all errors in the broken QR code API code. All tests now pass locally and on GitHub Actions.

- **How to Verify**:
  1. Check my **GitHub Actions** page for successful builds.
  2. Run `pytest` locally to confirm all tests pass.
  3. Use `docker compose up --build` to run the app and visit `http://localhost/docs`.

Everything is now working correctly.
